# interview_tip_by_chatgpt_sql
Sure! Here are ten common SQL queries and operations often asked in interviews, focusing on ranking and window functions, particularly the DENSE_RANK() function:

Basic DENSE_RANK() usage:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  employee_id,
  salary,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM
  employees;
DENSE_RANK() with partition:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  employee_id,
  department_id,
  salary,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM
  employees;
Finding the nth highest salary:

sql
Copy code
WITH ranked_salaries AS (
  SELECT
    salary,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
  FROM
    employees
)
SELECT salary
FROM ranked_salaries
WHERE rank = 3; -- Change the rank number to find the nth highest salary
Using DENSE_RANK() to remove duplicates:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  *
FROM (
  SELECT
    name,
    value,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY value DESC) AS rank
  FROM
    data
) ranked_data
WHERE rank = 1;
Combining DENSE_RANK() with other window functions:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  employee_id,
  salary,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,
  SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS total_salary_by_department
FROM
  employees;
Finding gaps in sequences using DENSE_RANK():

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  value,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY value) - value AS gap
FROM
  numbers;
Filtering top N records per group:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  *
FROM (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    salary,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
  FROM
    employees
) ranked_employees
WHERE rank <= 3; -- Top 3 salaries per department
Using DENSE_RANK() with JOIN:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  e.employee_id,
  e.salary,
  d.department_name,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.department_id ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS rank
FROM
  employees e
JOIN
  departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
Combining DENSE_RANK() with aggregation:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  department_id,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC) AS rank
FROM
  employees
GROUP BY
  department_id;
Using DENSE_RANK() to find duplicates:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
  value,
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
FROM
  data
GROUP BY
  value
HAVING
  COUNT(*) > 1;
These queries showcase various use cases of the DENSE_RANK() function, illustrating how it can be used to rank records, handle partitions, and perform advanced data analysis tasks.

differnces between view and cte
ChatGPT
Views and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are both powerful SQL constructs that can help organize and simplify complex queries, but they have distinct differences in terms of their usage, scope, and functionality. Here's a detailed comparison:

Differences Between Views and CTEs
Feature	View	CTE
Definition	A view is a stored query that you can treat as a table in your database. It is defined with the CREATE VIEW statement.	A CTE is a temporary result set defined within the execution scope of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, using the WITH clause.
Persistence	Views are persistent database objects that remain in the database until explicitly dropped.	CTEs are not persistent and exist only for the duration of the query in which they are defined.
Storage	Views do not store data; they store the query that generates the data. The data is fetched from the base tables each time the view is queried.	CTEs also do not store data; they are temporary result sets generated during the execution of the query.
Scope	Views are global and can be referenced by any query within the database.	CTEs are local to the query in which they are defined and cannot be reused outside that query.
Indexing	Indexes cannot be created directly on views (except for materialized views, which are supported in some databases and store data).	CTEs cannot have indexes directly, but the underlying tables involved in the CTE can have indexes.
Modification	Views can sometimes be updatable (depending on the database and the complexity of the view), allowing INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.	CTEs are read-only and do not support INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations directly.
Usage	Views are used to simplify complex queries, provide a level of abstraction, and enforce security by restricting access to certain data.	CTEs are primarily used to simplify complex queries, break down queries into more manageable parts, and improve readability within a single query.
Recursive Capabilities	Views do not support recursion.	CTEs support recursion, allowing you to define recursive queries using the WITH RECURSIVE clause.
Parameterization	Views cannot directly accept parameters.	CTEs cannot directly accept parameters, but they can be part of a query that uses parameters.
Materialization	Standard views are not materialized, but some databases support materialized views that store the result set.	CTEs are not materialized and are re-evaluated each time the query is executed.
Example of a View
sql
Copy code
-- Create a view to select employees with high salaries
CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS
SELECT 
  employee_id, 
  employee_name, 
  salary 
FROM 
  employees 
WHERE 
  salary > 70000;

-- Query the view
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  HighSalaryEmployees;
Example of a CTE
sql
Copy code
-- Use a CTE to select employees with high salaries
WITH HighSalaryCTE AS (
  SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    employee_name, 
    salary 
  FROM 
    employees 
  WHERE 
    salary > 70000
)
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  HighSalaryCTE;
Summary
Views are persistent and can be referenced by multiple queries. They provide a way to encapsulate and reuse complex queries, enforce security, and simplify access to data.
CTEs are temporary and exist only within the scope of a single query. They are useful for breaking down complex queries, improving readability, and enabling recursive queries.
Understanding these differences helps in choosing the right tool for the task at hand, enhancing the efficiency and clarity of your SQL code.

mostly query asked on normalization for data engineering  role and data analyst role
ChatGPT
Normalization is a key concept in database design and is frequently discussed in data engineering and data analyst roles. Here are some common queries and questions related to normalization that are often asked in interviews:

Data Engineering Role
Explain Normalization and Its Objectives:

Question: What is normalization, and why is it important in database design?
Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The main objectives are to eliminate redundant data, ensure data dependencies make sense, and minimize the potential for anomalies in data operations.
Describe the Different Normal Forms:

Question: What are the first three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), and how do you achieve each?
Answer:
1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures that all columns contain atomic, indivisible values and each column has a unique name.
2NF (Second Normal Form): Achieved when a table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.
3NF (Third Normal Form): Achieved when a table is in 2NF and all attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes.
Convert a Table to a Higher Normal Form:

Question: Given a denormalized table, how would you decompose it to achieve 2NF or 3NF?
Example: Given a table with OrderID, ProductID, ProductName, and Quantity, how would you decompose it into 2NF and 3NF?
Design a Database Schema in Normalized Form:

Question: Design a normalized database schema for an e-commerce application that includes customers, orders, and products.
Answer: The design would involve creating separate tables for Customers, Orders, and Products, ensuring that each table adheres to normalization principles to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.
Normalization vs. Denormalization:

Question: What is the difference between normalization and denormalization? When would you choose denormalization?
Answer: Normalization aims to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity, while denormalization involves intentionally introducing redundancy to improve query performance. Denormalization is often used in read-heavy applications where query performance is critical.
Data Analyst Role
Identify Normalization Issues in a Given Dataset:

Question: Given a dataset with columns OrderID, ProductID, ProductName, CustomerName, and OrderDate, identify any normalization issues and suggest improvements.
Answer: The dataset may contain redundancy (e.g., ProductName and CustomerName repeated for each order). Normalization would involve creating separate tables for Products, Customers, and Orders.
Analyze the Impact of Normalization on Query Performance:

Question: How does normalization affect query performance, and what strategies can be used to optimize performance in a normalized database?
Answer: Normalization can sometimes lead to complex joins that impact query performance. Strategies for optimization include indexing, query optimization, and selective denormalization.
Normalization in Data Warehousing:

Question: How does normalization apply in the context of data warehousing and star schemas?
Answer: In data warehousing, normalization is often relaxed to improve query performance and simplify reporting, leading to star or snowflake schemas. Fact tables are typically denormalized, while dimension tables may be normalized.
Normalization and Data Integrity:

Question: How does normalization contribute to data integrity, and what are the potential pitfalls if normalization is not applied correctly?
Answer: Normalization helps maintain data integrity by reducing redundancy and ensuring logical data dependencies. Poor normalization can lead to data anomalies, inconsistencies, and increased maintenance complexity.
Normalization vs. Data Quality:

Question: How does normalization relate to data quality, and what steps can be taken to ensure high data quality in a normalized database?
Answer: Normalization helps improve data quality by organizing data logically and reducing redundancy. Ensuring data quality involves additional steps like data validation, consistent data entry, and regular audits.
Examples
Example of Normalization Process:
Initial Table (Unnormalized):

Understanding and applying normalization principles is crucial for designing efficient, scalable, and maintainable databases, and these questions will help prepare for interviews in both data engineering and data analyst roles.

query for normalization that asked in interview
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some SQL query-based questions focused on normalization that are commonly asked in interviews. These questions often require you to identify normalization issues, decompose tables into normalized forms, or manipulate data to reflect normalization concepts.

1. Identify Normalization Issues in a Given Table
Question:
Given the following table structure, identify any normalization issues and write SQL queries to decompose it into normalized forms:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    ProductID INT,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Quantity INT,
    OrderDate DATE
);
Answer:
The table has normalization issues because it contains redundant data. Here's how to decompose it:

Decompose into 1NF:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    OrderDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100)
);
Decompose into 2NF and 3NF:

sql
Copy code
-- Assuming that ProductID and CustomerID are foreign keys in the Orders table.
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (
    OrderID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID),
    FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Orders(OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100)
);
2. Convert a Denormalized Table to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF
Question:
Consider the following table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE EmployeeData (
    EmployeeID INT,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100),
    ManagerName VARCHAR(100)
);
Write SQL queries to normalize this table into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

Answer:

1NF:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE EmployeeData (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100),
    ManagerName VARCHAR(100)
);
2NF:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100),
    ManagerName VARCHAR(100)
);
3NF:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100),
    ManagerID INT
);

CREATE TABLE Managers (
    ManagerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ManagerName VARCHAR(100)
);
3. Query to Normalize Data in a Given Table
Question:
Given the table Sales with columns SaleID, Product, Category, Quantity, and Price, write SQL queries to normalize this table.

Answer:

Normalization Process:

Create normalized tables:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SaleID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);
Insert data into normalized tables:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Category)
SELECT DISTINCT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Product) AS ProductID,
    Product AS ProductName,
    Category
FROM Sales;

INSERT INTO Sales (SaleID, ProductID, Quantity, Price)
SELECT
    SaleID,
    p.ProductID,
    Quantity,
    Price
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.Product = p.ProductName AND s.Category = p.Category;
4. Write Queries to Check Normalization
Question:
Given a normalized table structure, write SQL queries to verify that normalization has been properly applied. For example, check that there are no redundant data entries and that all dependencies are correctly implemented.

Answer:

Verify No Redundant Data:

sql
Copy code
-- Check for redundant products
SELECT ProductName, COUNT(*)
FROM Products
GROUP BY ProductName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Verify Correct Foreign Key Relationships:

sql
Copy code
-- Check for orphaned records in Sales
SELECT s.SaleID
FROM Sales s
LEFT JOIN Products p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE p.ProductID IS NULL;
Check Dependency Integrity:

sql
Copy code
-- Check for correct category assignment
SELECT DISTINCT Category
FROM Products
WHERE Category IS NULL;
5. Normalization Impact on Query Performance
Question:
How would you address performance issues in a normalized database schema when dealing with complex queries?

Answer:

Indexes: Create indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up lookups.

sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_productid ON Sales(ProductID);
Denormalization: Introduce some denormalization for performance-critical queries if necessary, such as adding summary tables or precomputed aggregates.

Optimized Queries: Write optimized queries that take advantage of the normalized structure, avoiding unnecessary joins and ensuring efficient access paths.

Understanding and applying normalization correctly is crucial for designing robust and efficient databases, and these queries will help you demonstrate your skills in both data engineering and data analysis roles.
